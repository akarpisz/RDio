# RDio
Running Distance Tracker
akarpisz.github.io/RDio
This application is mainly for runners, or those who take long walks. It's purpose is to use geolocation to calculate and track the distance you've ran.

-I'm still working on getting it to function solely as a mobile web browser page. It has not been developed into a full application.

-Once this application is functional, it'll be adapted for use on mobile devices. using React-Native.

-I'm still working out some bugs. I havent added the distance to the html yet, so currrently the application doesn't do much unless you  can see the console (which isn't helpful on a mobile device).

I'm developing this primarily for my own use, to use while jogging, and to challenge myself as a developer. I'm sure there are applications currently available that do the exact same thing I'm trying to accomplish. But nothing's better than doing it yourself.

To be added:
-User's current distance ran, continuously updated;
-Mapping feature allowing user to have a live view of the route they've run.
-Weather projections for time the user plans to run.
Further down the line:
-Storage of the user's past running distances, and their routes (if they differ).
-Ability to share distances and routes on social media.

If you have any suggestions or advice, open an issue in this repo.
