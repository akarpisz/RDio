Running Distance Tracker
akarpisz.github.io/RDio
This application is mainly for runners, or those who take long walks. It's purpose is to use geolocation to calculate and track the distance you've ran.

-I'm still working on getting it to function solely as a mobile web browser page. It has not been developed into a full application.

-Once this application is functional, it'll be adapted for use on mobile devices. using React-Native.

-I'm still working out some bugs. I havent added the distance to the html yet, so currrently the application doesn't do much unless you  can see the console (which isn't helpful on a mobile device).

I'm developing this primarily for my own use, to use while jogging, and to challenge myself as a developer. I'm sure there are applications currently available that do the exact same thing I'm trying to accomplish. But nothing's better than doing it yourself.


If you have any suggestions or advice, open an issue in this repo.
